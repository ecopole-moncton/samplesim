The goal of the R package `samplesim` is to estimate sample size effects in 
stable isotope mixing solutions.



## System requierements

The package `samplesim` requires the freeware 
[JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/).

This package will require either the packages
[MixSIAR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MixSIAR/index.html), 
[simmr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simmr/) or
[siar](https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/siar) (which is now defunct and thus
not recommended any more. If you insist we recommend installing it using the
following command: 


```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("AndrewLJackson/siar@v.4.2.4"))
```



## Installation

You can install the stable version of `samplesim` with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Install stable version of 'samplesim' ----
install.packages("samplesim")
```



Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Install 'remotes' package (if not already installed) ----
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## Install development version of 'samplesim' ----
remotes::install_github("ecopole-moncton/samplesim")
```

Then you can attach the package `samplesim`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("samplesim")
```
